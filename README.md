- 1930 Close to done loading up question in the formular, problem with lambda expression, found that the pom file had set the java version 1.7 as a target and source.
- 2025: Problem with serializing, forgot one needed to implement the interface serializable.
- 2025-2115: Phonecall
- 2115: Dinner
- 21:50-2200 Fixing bug that question two formular gets added a second time on third start
- 2200-2230: Experimenting with firebase functions. Too much work to add new functionality, aborted.
- 2230-2330: Break
